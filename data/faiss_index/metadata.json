Since height is genetically determined to a large extent, taller people have a heritable increase in cancer risk.[88]\nPhysical agents\n\nSome substances cause cancer primarily through their physical, rather than chemical, effects.[89] A prominent example of this is prolonged exposure to asbestos, naturally occurring mineral fibers that are a major cause of mesothelioma (cancer of the serous membrane) usually the serous membrane surrounding the lungs.[89] Other substances in this category, including both naturally occurring and synthetic asbestos-like fibers, such as wollastonite, attapulgite, glass wool and rock wool, are believed to have similar effects.[89] Non-fibrous particulate materials that cause cancer include powdered metallic cobalt and nickel and crystalline silica (quartz, cristobalite and tridymite).[89] Usually, physical carcinogens must get inside the body (such as through inhalation) and require years of exposure to produce cancer.[89]\n\nPhysical trauma resulting in cancer is relatively rare.[90] Claims that breaking bones resulted in bone cancer, for example, have not been proven.[90] Similarly, physical trauma is not accepted as a cause for cervical cancer, breast cancer or brain cancer.[90] One accepted source is frequent, long-term application of hot objects to the body.",

Some psychotherapists claimed that treatment to change the patient's outlook on life would cure the cancer.[244] Among other effects, this belief allowed society to blame the victim for having caused the cancer (by \"wanting\" it) or having prevented its cure (by not becoming a sufficiently happy, fearless and loving person).[245] It also increased patients' anxiety, as they incorrectly believed that natural emotions of sadness, anger or fear shorten their lives.[245] The idea was ridiculed by Susan Sontag, who published Illness as Metaphor while recovering from treatment for breast cancer in 1978.[244] Although the original idea is now generally regarded as nonsense, the idea partly persists in a reduced form with a widespread, but incorrect, belief that deliberately cultivating a habit of positive thinking will increase survival.[245] This notion is particularly strong in breast cancer culture.[245]\n\nOne idea about why people with cancer are blamed or stigmatized, called the just-world fallacy, is that blaming cancer on the patient's actions or attitudes allows the blamers to regain a sense of control.",
